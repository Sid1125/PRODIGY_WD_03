I am glad to share my progress on the Web Dev Internship. Today I completed the 3rd task which was to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

From building this Tic-Tac-Toe project, I learned the following:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Integration: 

Structured the game board, styled it, and used JavaScript to add interactive functionality.

DOM Manipulation: Updated the game board dynamically with player moves and AI responses by modifying class attributes.

Event Handling: Captured user clicks and toggled game state between the player and AI using event listeners.

AI with Minimax Algorithm: Implemented an optimal AI for Tic-Tac-Toe, learning how the Minimax algorithm works for decision-making in games.

Game Logic: Developed core game logic for tracking player moves, checking for winners, and handling draws or restarts.

Responsive UI and Dark Mode: Added a dark mode toggle and ensured the UI was responsive and visually appealing.

Problem Solving: Debugged issues related to functionality and styling while maintaining game logic consistency.

This project helped me enhance my JavaScript skills, especially in implementing algorithms and building interactive web applications.
